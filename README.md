### Bijan Rahnema ðŸ‘‹

Hi ðŸ‘‹! My name is Bijan. I'm running an independent software development company called [Screen Island](https://screenisland.com). 
We believe most software is too complex. 
Therefore we are on a mission to make software more approachable and achieve more with less effort using sustainable and maintainable concepts and frameworks.
We are specialized in Ruby on Rails, Go and C#.
